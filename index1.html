                    <p>My name is Clay Hibbard, and this is my first attempt at a functional website using only CSS and HTML to keep it working. I have had many careers in my life, but what has drawn me to coding is the quest for knowledge and the fact that it is one of a very few select careers that can become a lifetime of unlimited learning, tempered only by time, willingness, and desire to learn. There is no knowledge ceiling, and I think I love that most about coding.</p><p>I have have done many things career wise in my life, but I find I'm always drawn to those fields where my drive can push me as far as I desire to go. Being new to coding, I'm not sure what direction I yet wish to travel, so I intend to explore all avenues, learn as much as I can, and see what I like</p>
